## 📌 Problem Statement

Enhancing student awareness on the **difference between Aadhaar-linked bank accounts and DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts** to reduce scholarship delays, rejections, and failures.

Many students mistakenly believe that linking Aadhaar with a bank account is sufficient for receiving scholarships via DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer). In reality, **proper Aadhaar seeding and DBT mapper activation** are required. This lack of awareness causes large-scale payment failures and repeated grievances.

This project is a **multi-channel, inclusive, AI-assisted awareness and guidance platform** that helps students:

- Understand the correct concepts
- Verify their Aadhaar–DBT status
- Take corrective action

The solution combines **web, WhatsApp, IVR, AI analytics, and physical CSC support** to ensure maximum reach and impact.
